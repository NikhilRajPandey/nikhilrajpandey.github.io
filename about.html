	  <p> I am not the guy in the above photo I just putted it here because I like his hairstyle and also his movie starstruck.
		Okay Now let me tell about my self. I am a guy who likes to do anything that I want like programming,proofing a random maths
		theorem (like calculation for sine angle <a href="https://github.com/nikhilrajpandey/sinFinder">Check</a>) writting like
		Anne Frank seriously I am so inspired from that girl but I don't consider myself very good in any of these field and seriously
		not in the writting ðŸ˜… </p>
	  <br>
	  <p> I hate doing school works like doing holiday homework/maintaining a school copy that is also a reason why teacher scold me.
		I try to ignore them But if they try to take me to principal or call to my parents then I just do that much work that will
		save me. Not a single word more than that. ðŸ˜…</p>
	  <br>
	  <p> I try to not get symapthy or validation from anyone but sometime I end up taking sympathy for my frizzy hair.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p> My interst in improving my hindi speaking skill came this from Iron Man 3 Hindi Dubbed Scene </p>

	  <p>
		As most of the educated people in north India or should I say in delhi know hindi but they just talk in english and rarely
		sometime they use sentences of hindi. I hate those people. Listen ! I don't hate people who always speak in english for
		International reach. I just hate people who blindly follow western culture and speak in 'hinglish' for looking cool and I don't
		want to be like them. ðŸ˜”
