<p>I am not the guy in the above photo I just putted it here because I like his hairstyle and also his movie starstruck. Okay Now let me tell about my self. I am a guy who likes to do anything that I want like programming,proofing a random maths theorem (like calculation for sine angle Check) writting like Anne Frank seriously I am so inspired from that girl but I don't consider myself very good in any of these field and seriously not in the writting ðŸ˜…</p>
<p><br>
I hate doing school works like doing holiday homework/maintaining a school copy that is also a reason why teacher scold me. I try to ignore them But if they try to take me to principal or call to my parents then I just do that much work that will save me. Not a single word more than that. ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>I try to not get symapthy or validation from anyone but sometime I end up taking sympathy for my frizzy hair.</p>
<p><br>
My interst in improving my hindi speaking skill came this from Iron Man 3 Hindi Dubbed Scene </p>

<p>As most of the educated people in north India or should I say in delhi know hindi but they just talk in english and rarely sometime they use sentences of hindi. I hate those people. Listen ! I don't hate people who always speak in english for International reach. I just hate people who blindly follow western culture and speak in 'hinglish' for looking cool and I don't want to be like them. ðŸ˜” </p>
