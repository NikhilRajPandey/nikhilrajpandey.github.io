<hr>
<p>First let me start with what is the problem with normal youtube. </p>
<h1>First Reason</h1>
<p>Whenever you open youtube It will show all the tempting videos on their homepage. I am not saying that these videos are tempting because I am addicted to them abviously No!. Understand the reason. Youtube track our each and every activity. How much we scroll ? how much we spent time on each video ? At which video thumnail our mouse cursor go ? Yeah I am serious. And based on this they will predict by machine learning algorithms which type of video you are going to watch and find tempting. Now you will tell me whats the problem In this thing ?</p>
<p>Well Here is it. The algorithm will get better and better about knowing your choices and after some time they will be very smart enough to keep you on the youtube. And Trust me this is a very serious issue and If you don't belive me then watch Social Dilenema.</p>
<p>Even when you open youtube in Private Window of Firefox even then it puts shorts (about some sigma boy after rejection) that is tempting for most people (not only for me) and I know that I hate that short but I end up watching like most of the people.</p>
<p>Summary: You can't defeat a algorithm in long run which is running on a super computer.</p>
<h1>Second</h1>
<p>Second Big reason is they can manipulate you very easily. Let me give you example by telling you my story. I never liked politics/social video But one day youtube recommended this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lekGy-j619A">Video</a> about Sugar Mafias.</p>
<p>So I clicked on it and watch the whole video and next day youtube again recommended me video of that channel about One Child trend in India.</p>
<p>and I end up watching that and started interested in political video. Now the whole point of the story is that youtube algorithm manipulated me by making me interested in politics that is not a harm but if youtube algorithm had recommended me some fakenews or wrong type of content I end up getting manuplated.</p>
<h1>Third</h1>
<p>Third Big reason is the unlimited dose of high dopamine content. I think I don't have to explain after youtube become tiktok.
Solutions</p>
<h1>Solutions</h1>
<p>Now let discuss some solutions for this. Install this extension <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/">Link</a> on your browser and enable Hide feed after that your youtube will look like this. You can watch bugs writer video for more practical view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i5DKHCAYlw&amp;ab_channel=BugsWriter">How to block all internet distractions / ads / malware / crap</a></p>

<hr>

<p>By removing the sidebar will help you to focus on your content without distraction [You can skip this If you are watching any non educational video on private window. As youtube algorithm don't know your past activity so It will give sidebar recommendations based on the tags of that video] and by removing the homepage you will not get many urges to open youtube again and again.
Now you can watch your content without the interference of any algorithm. But before doing this list all the channel that you havn't subscribed that you think will be useful to you and subscribe them. So that you don't miss any good video that you used to watch.</p>
<p>Next tip I want to give you is If you watch shorts stop it. Instead watch the compliation videos of those shorts. So that you don't get lost into the infinite scroll.</p>
<p>I know this will be hard for you as you are already addicted to that algorithm builded homepage/recommendation system. But things will get easy. (I am sounding like Sandeep Maheshwari ðŸ˜…)</p>
<p>Feel Free to customize these solutions according to your need But do something Because Youtube algorithm is not good for us.</p>
